I am currently a PhD student at the [Institute of Computational Mathematics and Scientific/Engineering Computing](https://icmsec.cc.ac.cn/), [Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science](http://www.amss.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.ac.cn/). I graduated from the [School of Mathematics of Jilin University](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/) in 2024 with a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. My research interests include log-concave sampling, optimization, optimal transport and stochastic analysis.

I am currently reading the book *Brownian Motion, Martingales, and Stochastic Calculus* written by Jean-Fran√ßois Le Gall. If you want to read this book with me, feel free to contact me.
