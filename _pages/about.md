I am currently a PhD student at the [Institute of Computational Mathematics and Scientific/Engineering Computing](https://icmsec.cc.ac.cn/), [Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science](http://www.amss.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I graduated from the School of Mathematics of Jilin University in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. My research interests include log-concave sampling, optimization, and stochastic analysis.
